# Employee Page
A simple web app to keep track of employee's and their details. Undertook the project to improve my understanding in server side rendering and the use of databases for data driven web apps.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
